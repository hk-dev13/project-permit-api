# A Comprehensive Summary of the CI/CD Debugging Journey

This document outlines the iterative debugging process undertaken to resolve a series of complex failures in the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. The journey involved tackling issues ranging from test authentication and application architecture to deployment permissions, ultimately leading to a successful production deployment.

### Phase 1: The Initial `401 UNAUTHORIZED` Failures

The primary issue was that all `pytest` tests targeting protected API endpoints were consistently failing in the CI environment with a `401 UNAUTHORIZED` status code.

**Initial Hypothesis & Fixes:**

1.  **Inconsistent HTTP Header Casing:** The first investigation revealed an inconsistency. The tests were sending the API key in a header named `X-API-Key` (lowercase 'k'), while the server was likely expecting `X-API-KEY`.
    *   **Action:** Standardized the header to `X-API-KEY` across all test files.

2.  **Unsafe Docker Tagging:** It was noted that the deployment workflow was pushing and pulling the `:latest` Docker tag. This is a risky practice in CI, as it can lead to race conditions where the wrong image is deployed.
    *   **Action:** The workflow was updated to use a specific, immutable commit SHA as the Docker image tag for deployments, ensuring the tested image is the one that gets deployed.

Despite these improvements, the `401 UNAUTHORIZED` errors persisted, indicating a deeper problem.

### Phase 2: Uncovering the Root Cause of Test Failures

The investigation shifted to how the Flask application, when run by `pytest`, was loading its configuration.

**Hypothesis 2: Configuration Loading Failure**

The theory was that the Flask app wasn't loading the `API_KEYS` provided by the CI environment secrets. An attempt was made to fix this by manually importing and calling a `load_api_keys` function from `api_server.py` within the test setup.

**New Error: `ImportError`**

This led to a new, more informative error: `ImportError: cannot import name 'load_api_keys'`. This was a critical clue. It proved that:
1.  The function did not exist in `api_server.py` as assumed.
2.  The application's architecture delegated authentication logic elsewhere (correctly identified as `api/utils/security.py`).

**The Real Problem: A Test Environment Timing Issue**

The root cause was a timing issue inherent to the test environment. The `security.py` module, which reads `os.getenv('API_KEYS')`, was likely being imported and initialized by `pytest` *before* the CI environment variables were fully available to the test process. The application was, therefore, operating with an empty list of valid keys.

**The Definitive Solution: `pytest-monkeypatch`**

The correct and standard way to solve this is by using `pytest`'s built-in `monkeypatch` fixture. This allows for safely and temporarily modifying environment variables *during* a test's execution.

*   **Action:** The test files (`test_global_routes.py` and `quick_test.py`) were refactored. The `monkeypatch` fixture was used to `setenv('API_KEYS', ...)` *before* the Flask test client was created. This guaranteed that whenever the validation logic in `security.py` was called, it would read the correct, patched environment variable.

This finally resolved all test failures.

### Phase 3: The Final Hurdle - Deployment Permissions

With the tests passing, a final deployment attempt was made. This revealed one last issue: the deployment step itself failed.

**Problem:** The logs indicated that the IAM user (`nanang`) configured in the GitHub Secrets did not have the necessary permissions to perform App Runner operations, specifically `apprunner:ListOperations` and likely others.

**Solution:** The IAM policy attached to the `nanang` user was updated to grant comprehensive App Runner permissions (`apprunner:*`).

### Conclusion: Success

After updating the IAM policy, the GitHub Actions workflow executed successfully from start to finish, resulting in a verified and successful deployment to AWS App Runner, as confirmed by the commit history. This journey highlights the importance of moving from surface-level
