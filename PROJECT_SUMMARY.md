🌍 Environmental Data Verification API - Project Summary
📋 Project Overview

The project aims to deliver a structured and unified environmental data verification API, accessible to developers, analysts, and businesses.

We transform raw, fragmented, and hard-to-access environmental datasets into consistent, standardized insights that can be directly integrated into other systems.

🎯 Focus & Goals
🔹 Project Focus: Environmental Data Verification

Building an API that presents environmental data in a standardized, cross-industry format.

🔹 Short-Term Goal: Global MVP

Evolving from a local (KLHK Indonesia) API proxy to a global Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with:

✅ Multi-source integration (EPA, ISO, EEA, EDGAR)

✅ Modular architecture (Flask Blueprints, clients, utils)

✅ Standardized data schema across sources

✅ Core endpoints (search, filter, stats)

🔹 Long-Term Goal: CEVS (Comprehensive Environmental Verification Score)

Creating a composite score (0–100) that holistically evaluates companies’ environmental performance, by aggregating:

EPA emissions (US)

EEA indicators (EU)

ISO 14001 certifications (global)

EDGAR pollutant data (UN/UCDB)

Target users:

🌱 ESG Investors

🌐 Global supply chain managers

🏛️ Regulators & industry watchdogs


ENV-based configuration:

EDGAR_XLSX_PATH, ISO_XLSX_PATH, EEA_CSV_URL, CEVS_POLLUTION_SOURCE, etc.

🚀 Achievements

✅ Flask modular API (Blueprints + CORS)
✅ Endpoints: /health, /permits/*, /global/*
✅ Data integrations: EPA, KLHK, ISO 14001, EEA, EDGAR
✅ CEVS Scoring engine: base score + iso_bonus + epa_penalty + eea_bonus + renewables_bonus + pollution_penalty + policy_bonus
✅ Unit tests (pytest) for core logic + smoke tests for /global/edgar
✅ Documentation: updated README + API_DOCUMENTATION
